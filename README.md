# HRnet

WealthHealth, my employer, uses an internal web application called HRnet that manages employee records. The application is old and uses jQuery on the front end, which leads to considerable bugs and increased internal complaints.
I'm in charge of converting this application to React, with the addition of a jQuery library.

**PROJECT GOALS**:

- Redesigning an application to reduce technical debt
- Analyze the performance of a web application
- Deploying a front-end application
- Programming in JavaScript with functional programming

## Side note:

I did units tests (cf folder of each page) and a documentation with JsDoc that you can find in projectFolder/docs/index.html. Right click on this html file then "open with [live server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)" and you should see the documentation in your browser.
